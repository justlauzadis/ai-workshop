Candidate1,"More than a year ago, I stumbled upon web development and have since dedicated most of my free time improving my skills.  As my projects grew more complex, I realized that without testing, it was impossible to make a reliable website. This led me to explore software testing fundamentals -  and that's where I am now. I believe that joining the Sourcery Academy for  Test Engineers would be the ideal next step in my journey: to gain hands-on experience and be a part of a community that values high-quality software.",One of the poor decisions I made in life was leaving my IT studies in VGTU after graduating high-school. Finding a job that didn't suite me and working in it for the past couple of years led me made reflect and start exploring IT fields during my free time. More than a year has passed and I can confidently say about saying that I've finally found something that truly excites and motivates me to grow.,"Vehicle testing would consist of several stages. First , I would perform a functional inspection, which includes checking critical systems such as breaks, tires, lights, fluid levels, without passing this stage that car wouldn't be considered road-ready. Second level inspection would focus on comfort and appearance including cleanliness, comfort, checking to ensure that the car is not only functional but also presentable and comfortable to use. Throughout this process I would apply my attention to detail and ability to follow structured procedures to get the best possible result.","At first, I would consider the risk that would arise if the lock is not fixed. Highest urgency would be if the apartment building main door lock is broken because it poses a security risk to the property and residents. Medium risk level would take broken lot lock because on it depends whether unauthorized vehicles and people can access it. Lastly, if it's the storage unit lock, I would assess urgency for changing it depending on how valuable items I have inside or how frequent I need that access. Urgency would go down if there is nothing valuable in it or if it's rarely used."
Candidate2,"Ever since high school I’ve had a strong passion for IT, I’ve participated in programming contests and received an excellent score from the national exam. Although I chose to study humanities, my interest in technology has remained, and I am looking for ways to expand my knowledge outside of university. Test engineering is especially interesting to me because it involves understanding the entire information system as well as customer needs and accessibility, which, as a humanities student, are concepts close to my professional field.","Overall, I am an optimistic person, and I tend to focus on positive outcomes of every situation, however, if I had to name a decision I regret, it would be choosing the wrong challenge for an Innovation Workshop programme I participated in. I was afraid my competences would not be enough for tech-related projects, so I chose a challenge that I felt comfortable and safe in. During the course of the workshop, I saw my friends grow through their work and gain valuable connections while I was stuck not being able to expand my skillset. This experience taught me that stagnancy is immeasurably worse than failure, and now I am more comfortable and motivated to take risks.","My first priority would be keeping details of all vehicles easily accessible and organised, using my skills of data administration. Having a schedule where I could keep track of all of the needed testing and upkeep procedures would be crucial as well, which my project management experience would help me coordinate. My personal qualities of responsibility and attention to detail would help to handle the work with scrutiny, ensuring no vehicle or its part gets overlooked.","The main criterion of urgency would be the value of items protected by the lock. The most urgent to fix would be the lock of my apartment door, followed by the lock of my storage unit (if in this scenario I have a car, a car door would also be urgent to fix). The second line of priority would fall on the main door of the apartment building because my belongings would still be protected by the apartment door. Assuming the parking area has a lockable door, it would also be second priority since there is still a working lock on the storage unit and my car is locked. Inner locks, like the lock of the door to the staircase, would be the least urgent because they serve as extra layers of protection."
Candidate3,"I'm really motivated to join the Sourcery Academy for Test Engineers because I’m ready for a fresh start and a well thought out career change. I took time to think seriously about what I enjoy, what I’m good at, and what kind of future I want. That’s how I discovered software testing. To learn more, I enrolled in a 3-month course ""Software and Mobile Application Testing"" at Edon Academy in Vilnius, which I’ll finish on June 6th. This course gave me a good starting point and made me even more sure that QA is the direction I want to take. I’m someone who notices small details, takes responsibility for my work, and enjoys solving problems—skills that I believe are important in testing. I’m excited to learn more through real projects, get to know how things are done in the industry, and be part of a team where I can keep growing. Joining this academy would help me gain the skills and confidence I need to start a stable and meaningful career in tech.","When I was younger, I decided to study Veterinary Medicine. It wasn’t a well thought out decision. I was naive and didn’t know what I wanted from life. That choice cost me a lot of time and money. Because of it, I’m not yet established in the labor market, even though I would like to be. Now, I approach things very differently. I’ve taken time to seriously think about my future and career possibilities. For some time, I’ve been interested in software testing and its features.","It depends on what my role is in the company. If I only work with documentation and digital systems, my plan would be: First of all, I’m going to look for the vehicle's technical passport in our company system and check if it’s valid. I will check and write down any red flags from the previous technical examination. Then, I will write a document listing these deficiencies and assign a responsible employee to observe and inspect the vehicle. If I'm responsible for this and qualified enough, I’ll do the technical part myself. My personal skills that can help in this case are attention to detail, responsibility, teamwork, and problem-solving.","If I understand right, the storage unit door is private - just for me, and the parking area doors are shared. If it's the parking area doors, I think the building management should be contacted.  Also, it's convenient that it doesn't just affect me, everyone with a parking space wants it fixed. Also, in the parking area, only cars have a lock system. It’s not a problem if the parking area is accessible for a short time to residents who don’t have a key. I'm assuming that you can reach the parking area directly from your house, without going outside . I think broken door leads from inside the house to the underground parking lot. But if it’s the storage unit door, I will try to urgently call a repair company. It also depends on whether I have expensive things inside. If the company can’t fix it quickly, I will try to come up with a temporary solution, like hanging a padlock. So my priority is my storage unit because valuable things that could be stolen might be inside."
Candidate4,"From a young age, I’ve been deeply fascinated by technology—always eager to understand how things work and how they can be improved. This curiosity naturally led me to the IT field, where I’ve found particular interest in software testing and quality assurance. I believe that building reliable and user-friendly systems is just as important as developing new features, and that’s where testing plays a critical role.  What draws me to the Sourcery Academy is not only the opportunity to learn from industry professionals but also to be challenged in a real-world environment that values precision, critical thinking, and continuous improvement. I am eager to gain hands-on experience, develop strong testing skills, and learn modern tools and methodologies used by top QA engineers.","After finishing school, I initially enrolled in a Mechatronics and Robotics program because it combined my interests in engineering, biology, medicine and technology. However, as I progressed through the curriculum, I realized that my real passion wasn’t in hardware or mechanical systems—it was in software, logic, and digital problem-solving. While the program was valuable, it didn’t fully align with what I was most excited to learn and do.  That experience led me to reflect deeply on my goals and interests. I made the decision to switch to an Information Technologies program, where I finally felt truly motivated and engaged. It was a tough choice to change direction, but it helped me understand the importance of aligning my education with my true passion.  If I could go back, I would spend more time exploring different areas of tech before committing to a specific field. Now, I actively research and seek out hands-on experiences before making long-term decisions. That mindset is also what led me to apply for Sourcery Academy—I want to keep learning in the right environment, with clear direction and practical goals.","To ensure vehicles are ready for use, I would follow a thorough inspection process, checking fluid levels, tire pressure and condition, lights, brakes, steering, and other essential systems. I would also carry out functional tests such as starting the engine, checking warning lights, and performing low-speed movements to ensure everything operates correctly. I keep accurate records, report faults promptly, and make sure all safety equipment is present and functional. I bring strong attention to detail, good time management, and a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential issues. I work well both independently and as part of a team, stay calm under pressure, and always prioritize safety and reliability.","If a door lock is broken, I assess urgency based on what it protects and who can access the area. A broken lock on my apartment door is very urgent as it puts personal safety at risk. A lock on the storage unit is moderately urgent, depending on what’s stored and how accessible it is from shared areas. If the broken lock is on the door leading to the parking space, it’s a high priority—especially if the area is shared or leads to vehicle access. An unsecured parking area increases the risk of theft or vandalism, so it should be addressed quickly to protect both personal property and community safety."
Candidate5,"I am currently a third-year Software Engineering student at Vilnius University, and I have recently developed a strong interest in test engineering. It has become one of my favorite subjects, and I want to deepen my knowledge in this field. I am eager to learn, have strong problem-solving skills, an analytical mindset, and great attention to detail. That’s why I believe this is the perfect position for me.","When I was working on a group project at university, I disagreed with the chosen approach. I had a better suggestion and shared it, but the other group members didn’t agree with me, so I stayed quiet to avoid conflict. In the end, the project had issues, and we received lower marks.  Now I understand that avoiding conflict isn’t always helpful. Since then, if I feel I have a better suggestion, I try to respectfully explain my point of view.","First of all, I would visually check if everything is okay (looking for leaks, damage, or anything else that could be seen from the outside). I would do this because not all buyers are familiar with cars, so visual damage is usually the first thing they notice. Then, I would check all the fluid levels, and afterwards, I would start the engine to listen for any unusual sounds and make sure everything is running properly. Next, I would go for a test drive to check the most important systems—brakes, lights, horn, and air conditioning.  For this task, I need attention to detail, technical knowledge, a sense of responsibility, and of course, experience.","The urgency to fix a door depends on which lock is broken and why I need to use that door. If my apartment door lock is broken, I would fix it immediately because I keep many valuable things in my apartment. The same goes for my car—if my car's door lock is broken, I would also fix it right away because I don’t want it to be stolen.  However, if the lock on my storage unit is broken, I would keep it in mind, but it wouldn’t be my top priority to fix, since I only store jam and pickle jars there.  If the building’s entrance door is broken, it depends on the situation. If I can still go outside, then it’s not urgent because my apartment remains secure. But if I can’t get out, then I would fix it immediately."
